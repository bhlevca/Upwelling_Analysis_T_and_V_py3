Description: Python Seawater
        ===============
        
        This is a Python re-write of the CSIRO seawater toolbox
        ([SEAWATER-3.3](http://www.cmar.csiro.au/datacentre/ext_docs/seawater.htm))
        for calculating the properties of sea water.  The package uses the formulas
        from Unesco's joint panel on oceanographic tables and standards, UNESCO 1981
        and UNESCO 1983 (EOS-80).
        
        The EOS-80 library is considered now obsolete;  it is provided here for
        compatibility with old scripts, and to allow a smooth transition to the new
        [TEOS-10](http://www.teos-10.org/).
        
        Notes and differences
        ---------------------
        The Python version default output unit for sw.dist is 'km' instead of  'nm'.
        
        Here we assume pressure as the first dimension, i.e. M pressure by N
        positions (See the table below).  The MatlabTM version does some guessing at
        this that we simply ignore to avoid confusions.

        Check out the [test_octave.py](https://github.com/ocefpaf/python-seawater/blob/master/test/test_octave.py)
        script to test the Python library against an available MatlabTM library (all
        inside Python via the oct2py package).  The current version was tested against
        seawater v3.3.

        What's new in this version of seawater
        ======================================
        
        06 August 06 2013
        -----------------
        Both `gpan` and `bfrq` accepts 3D arrays now.
        
        22 September 2010
        -----------------
        Fixed inconsistency in use of ITS-90* and increase convergence precision from
        1e-4 to 1e-10 for `cndr`.
        
        * Note: Not sure if this fix is needed!  Check this!!
        
        19 April 2006  release 3.2
        --------------------------
        Corrected sign of potential vorticity in `bfrq`.
        
        24 November 2005  release 3.1
        -----------------------------
        Added `swvel` to compute surface wave velocity.
        
        12 December 2003  release 3.0
        -----------------------------
        Converted code so that temperature is now ITS-90 throughout.
        
        25 June 1999  release 2.0.2
        ---------------------------
        Coding changes to enable functions to return the same shape vector as
        the input arguments.  In previous releases, some functions returned
        column vectors for row vector input.  Also some other tidying up.
        
        22 April 1998  release 2.0.1
        ----------------------------
        `satAr`    New routine.  Solubility of Ar in seawater
        `satN2`    New routine.  Solubility of N2 in seawater
        `satO2`    New routine.  Solubility of O2 in seawater
        `test`     Updated to include tests for above
        
        April 1998  release 1.2e
        ------------------------
        `alpha`    Fixed bug where temp used in calculations regardless of the keyword.
        
        15 November 1994 release 1.2d
        -----------------------------
        `bfrq`   Now also returns potential vorticity.  Thanks to Greg Johnson
                 (gjohnson@pmel.noaa.gov)
        
        `gvel`   OMEGA=7.29e-5 changed to OMEGA=7.292e-5 to be consistent with `f`
        
        IMPORTANT API CHANGE: The usage of `alpha`, `beta` and `aonb` routines has
        changed!  All these routines expect (S,T,P) to be passed instead of (S,PTMP,P)
        as in previous releases of seawater.  Fast execution can still be obtained by
        passing ptmp=True see help.
        
        19 October 1994 release 1.2c
        ----------------------------
        `bfrq`   Fixed bug where LAT = [] was needed as argument when no latitude
                 values are being passed.  Now pass PRESSURE instead of DEPTH ->
                 more consistent though only a negligible change is answers.
        
        12 October 1994 release 1.2b
        ----------------------------
        First official release and announcement on the networks.
